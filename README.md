# UFOs

## Purpose 

The purpose of this webpage is to allow users to access UFO sightings data by using a variety of filter options such as date, shape, and location.

## Drawbacks and Recommendations 

There are two major drawbacks from this applicaiton. The first drawback is the filtering itself. The user must match each field to the data in order to pull the data they are looking for. The other drawback is how outdated the information is. Users are unable to filter and find recent UFO information. 

My first recommendation is to bring back the filter button.  My second recommendation is to update the information so users can see more recent information.
